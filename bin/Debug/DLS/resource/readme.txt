                 resource
------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a number of subdirectories, each
of which contains some sort of resource used by IDL. The
subdirectories are:

  - X11 (Motif platforms only)
    The "X11" directory and its subdirectories contain
    Motif resources used by IDL. It is unlikely that you
    will need to use or alter any of the files in the X11
    hierarchy directly.

  - bitmaps
    The "bitmaps" directory contains the bitmap files
    used by IDL.

  - colors
    The "colors" directory contains default color tables
    used by IDL.

  - dm (Motif platforms only)
    The "dm" directory contains resources used by the IDL
    DataMiner option.

  - fonts
    The "fonts" directory contains font resources, including
    Hershey font descriptions, TrueType and PostScript fonts.

  - itools
    The "itools" directory contains subdirectories for
    iTool resources that are available to all IDL users,
    including system-wide styles and macros.

  - langcat
    The "langcat" directory contains subdirectories for
    language catalogs used by IDL applications supplied
    by RSI.

  - maps
    The "maps" directory contains map database and resource
    files used by the IDL MAP_* routines.

  - pref
    Location of the distribution preference file (idl.pref).
    Under Microsoft Windows, the default development environment
    macro definitions are also found here.

  - xprinter (Motif platforms only)
    The "xprinter" directory contains resources used by IDL's
    printer manager. IDL uses Xprinter software from Bristol
    Technology to provide print management on Motif platforms.
